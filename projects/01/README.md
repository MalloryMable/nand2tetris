## Basic Gates
A series of simple gates built out of NAND Gates or previously built gates. I aimed for as few NANDs as possible in any given gate. As well as some multibit implementations of these gates.
* NOT
* AND
* OR
* XOR
* Multiplexor (MUX)
* Demultiplexor (DMUX)
* NOT 16-Bit
* AND 16-Bit
* OR 16-Bit
* MUX 16-Bit
* DMUX 16-Bit
* 8 Way OR
* 4 Way MUX 16-Bit
* 8 Way MUX 16-Bit
* 4 Way DMUX 16-Bit
* 8 Way DMUX 16-Bit
